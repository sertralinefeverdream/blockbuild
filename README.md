# blockbuild

Blockbuild is a 2D block-based survival game loosely modelled on games such as Minecraft or Terraria. You can build blocks, craft and collect items, mine, and encounter various NPC all within a theoretically infinite and randomly-generated world. This project was my A-Level Computer Science NEA project during my time at Queen Mary's College from 2022-2024. The code is not very great and borderline spaghetti-like but it was a challenge to create and fun too.

## Quickstart
- ** I recommend using Python 3.9.x**
- Download the repository as a compressed zip and extract or clone the repository via Git and cd into the directory.
- Install the required packages via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `python src/main.py`

## Controls

- W - Jump
- A - Move Left
- D - Move Right
- Left Mouse - Attack/Break
- Right Mouse - Place Block
- E - Open Inventory
- F - Interact with special blocks
- Esc - Pause Game

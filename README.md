# blockbuild

Blockbuild is a 2D block-based survival game loosely modelled on games such as Minecraft or Terraria. You can build blocks, craft and collect items, mine, and encounter various NPC all within a theoretically infinite and randomly-generated world. This project was my A-Level Computer Science NEA project during my time at Queen Mary's College from 2022-2024. The code is not very great and borderline spaghetti-like but it was a challenge to create and fun too.
